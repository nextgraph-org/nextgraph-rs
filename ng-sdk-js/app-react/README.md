React example app for NextGraph

## NextGraph

> NextGraph brings about the convergence of P2P and Semantic Web technologies, towards a decentralized, secure and privacy-preserving cloud, based on CRDTs.
>
> This open source ecosystem provides solutions for end-users (a platform) and software developers (a framework), wishing to use or create **decentralized** apps featuring: **live collaboration** on rich-text documents, peer to peer communication with **end-to-end encryption**, offline-first, **local-first**, portable and interoperable data, total ownership of data and software, security and privacy. Centered on repositories containing **semantic data** (RDF), **rich text**, and structured data formats like **JSON**, synced between peers belonging to permissioned groups of users, it offers strong eventual consistency, thanks to the use of **CRDTs**. Documents can be linked together, signed, shared securely, queried using the **SPARQL** language and organized into sites and containers.
