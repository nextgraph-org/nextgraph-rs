# persistent LocalBroker

Example of LocalBroker configured with persistence to disk

run with:

```
cargo run -p nextgraph -r --example persistent
```

we assume that you run this command from the root of the git repo (nextgraph-rs).

the `-r` for release version is important, without it, the creation and opening of the wallet will take ages.
